"""
services package — Business logic and service layer functions.

This package contains service-layer functions that coordinate multiple
repository operations, enforce business rules, and use the UnitOfWork
pattern for transactional consistency across multiple databases.

All service functions follow UoW pattern:
- Open UnitOfWork for multi-DB coordination
- Inject connections into repository functions
- Auto-commit on success, auto-rollback on exception
- Proper connection lifecycle management
